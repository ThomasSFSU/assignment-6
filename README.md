## Description
This project demonstrates several important concepts in JavaScript by taking a user entered text and performing a frequency analysis on each word entered by the user. It uses dynamic calls to the DOM API from the script page to update the webpage based on the user input.

## Challenges
One of the interesting parts about this project was figuring out how to utilize JavaScript's built in sorting function. I also had to think of a few different options before I chose to implement a map data structure to simplify frequency analysis. With the use of a map for frequency analysis, I was able to optimize runtime of this aspect down to linear time complexity. The interenal sorting algorithm used by JavaScript likely makes the overall runtime either loglinear or quadratic.
